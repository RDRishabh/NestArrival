What this means in simple terms: You pay to contact verified owners. If no owner replies, you get a refund. We verify your documents securely. We do not sell your data. You must be at least 18 years old.

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to NestArrival. By accessing our platform, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms & Conditions. NestArrival operates as an international platform. Users are responsible for complying with the laws of their home country and destination.

## 2. Age Requirement
You must be at least 18 years old to create an account and use NestArrival's paid services.

## 3. Verified Connection Platform
NestArrival is a verified connection platform. We connect you with property owners but are not responsible for the terms of any tenancy agreement made between you and an owner.

## 4. Refund Policy & Verification
A refund is available if none of the verified owners you contacted reply to your messages within your active subscription period.

A valid response means the verified owner replies to your message through the NestArrival chat within your active plan period. An automated reply or an out-of-office message does not count as a response.

Verification is carried out by NestArrival's internal team. All team members are trained in document handling and privacy compliance. Verification typically takes 1–3 business days.

Your passport and visa documents are used only for identity verification. They are encrypted, stored securely, and deleted after verification is complete. No documents are shared with third parties.
